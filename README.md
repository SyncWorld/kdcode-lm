This repository contains code for paper:


>Ting Chen, Martin Renqiang Min, Yizhou Sun, "[Learning K-way D-dimensional Discrete Codes For Compact Embedding Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09464)" Thirty-fifth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'18), Stockholm, Sweden, July. 2018.


To run the code, enter scripts folder, execute \*.sh, results (log, as well as checkpoints etc.) will be saved into the results folder.

The code is based on [tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.4.0/tutorials/rnn/ptb). Tensorflow 1.4 was originally used, but it seems the code also works in higher versions.
